/* This is a multi line comment
 * 
 * Just like Javascript, we need a semicolon after each line
 * 
 * Variables:
 *    Must declare (or make) variable before we use it
 *      When declaring a variable, we must also identify it's data type.
 *      
 *    Variables can only hold one data type, and this data type 
 *      CANNOT BE CHANGED
 *      
 * Data Types:
 *    int -> integer
 *    char -> single character, use single quotes 'c'
 *    float -> number with a decimal
 *    String -> multiple characters, use double quotes "This is a string"
 *    boolean -> true or false value
 *    
 * Functions:
 *    To write a function, we need a return data type, 
 *       parenthesis after then name of our function,
 *       and curly braces to hold the code. 
 *       
 *    If we do not have a return value, then we can use void.
 *    
 *    Example:
 *      void turnRight(){
 *        //code to turn right, return nothing
 *      }
 *    
 *    If we need a parameter (info to pass in), 
 *       then we provide the data type our function 
 *       should expect to receive. 
 *    
 *    Example:   
 *      int someFunctionName() {
 *        // do stuff, return type int
 *      }
